Arrows show the \"instantiation\" process from class to objects.\n\n**Layout:**\n\n- Left side: A single \"cookie cutter\" shape labeled \"Dog class\" with a list of attributes (name, breed, age) and methods (bark, sit, fetch)\n- Right side: Three \"cookie\" shapes, each labeled as a Dog object with different values:\n  - Dog 1: name=\"Buddy\", breed=\"Golden Retriever\", age=3\n  - Dog 2: name=\"Luna\", breed=\"Poodle\", age=5\n  - Dog 3: name=\"Max\", breed=\"Beagle\", age=1\n- Arrows from the cookie cutter to each cookie labeled \"instantiation\"\n\n**Interactive elements:**\n\n- Hover over the class to highlight all shared structure\n- Hover over any object to see its unique attribute values\n- Click a \"Create New Dog\" button to animate a new cookie being \"pressed out\" with random attributes\n\n**Color scheme:** Class in blue, objects in warm cookie-brown tones with colored sprinkle accents\n**Responsive:** Layout adjusts from horizontal (wide screens) to vertical (narrow screens)\n\n**Instructional Rationale:** The concrete visual analogy of cookie cutter to cookies makes the abstract class-vs-object distinction tangible. Interactive creation of new objects reinforces that many instances come from one class.\n</details>",

Arrows show that class attributes are referenced from the class, not duplicated per object.\n\n**Layout:**\n\n- Top: A blue box representing the `Dog` class, showing `species = \"Canis familiaris\"`\n- Below: Three green boxes representing Dog instances (buddy, luna, max)\n- Each instance box shows its own name, breed, age values\n- Dashed arrows from each instance to the class attribute box for `species`\n- Solid borders around instance attributes to show they are \"owned\" by the object\n\n**Interactive elements:**\n\n- Hover over `species` in the class box to highlight all dashed arrows connecting to instances\n- Hover over any instance attribute to see it highlighted only on that one object\n- Click \"Add Dog\" to create a new instance box with random attributes and a new dashed arrow\n- Toggle \"Show Memory Addresses\" to reveal that all instances reference the same class attribute location\n\n**Color scheme:** Class box in blue, instance boxes in green, shared attribute arrows in orange dashed lines\n**Responsive:** Boxes reflow vertically on narrow screens\n\n**Instructional Rationale:** Memory diagrams make the invisible visible. Seeing that class attributes live in one place (the class) while instance attributes are stored per object reinforces the conceptual difference. Interactive arrows clarify the reference relationship.\n</details>",

Introducing students to this visual format early helps them plan classes before coding and read documentation that uses UML notation.\n</details>",

Direct access to the vault is blocked.\n\n**Layout:**\n\n- Center: A large \"vault\" box representing the Dog object, with private attributes (`_age`, `_breed`) shown inside\n- Front of vault: Two windows labeled \"Getter\" and \"Setter\"\n- Outside: A figure representing \"outside code\" trying to access the vault\n- Path 1 (green, allowed): Outside code -> Getter window -> receives age value\n- Path 2 (green, allowed): Outside code -> Setter window -> value validated -> stored in vault\n- Path 3 (red, blocked): Outside code -> tries to reach directly into vault -> big red X\n\n**Interactive elements:**\n\n- Click \"Try Direct Access\" to animate the blocked attempt with a red flash and error message\n- Click \"Use Getter\" to animate a successful read through the getter window\n- Click \"Use Setter (valid)\" to animate a successful write with a green checkmark\n- Click \"Use Setter (invalid)\" to animate a blocked write with a validation error\n\n**Color scheme:** Vault in dark gray, getter window in green, setter window in blue, blocked paths in red\n**Responsive:** Single-column layout on narrow screens\n\n**Instructional Rationale:** The bank vault analogy makes the abstract concept of encapsulation concrete. Animating both allowed and blocked access paths helps students understand why getters and setters exist and how they protect data integrity.\n</details>",
