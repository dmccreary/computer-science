# LinkedIn Announcement Skill Run

## Summary
- Executed the `linkedin-announcement-generator` skill to craft LinkedIn-ready posts for the Computer Science intelligent textbook.
- Gathered site metadata from `mkdocs.yml`, audience scope from `docs/course-description.md`, content stats from the README metrics table, and MicroSim details from `docs/sims/index.md`.
- Produced full, medium, and concise announcement variations plus posting tips, following the skill’s tone, structure, and hashtag requirements.

## Skill Reference
- Skill path: `/Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/claude-skills/skills/linkedin-announcement-generator/SKILL.md`
- Key workflow items applied: metadata extraction, metric synthesis, multi-length post creation, disclosure of AI tooling, call-to-action and hashtag validation.

## Key Metrics Used
- 20 chapters covering the full AP Computer Science (Python) pathway.
- 400 concepts mapped in the learning graph with ISO 11179 glossary coverage (400 terms).
- 17 browser-based MicroSims (from `docs/sims/index.md`).
- 147,555 total words across `docs/*.md` (~590 printed pages @ 250 words/page).
- 627 runnable code blocks, 3,639 list items, and quality score 100/100 (from README metrics table).

## Steps
1. Confirmed skill instructions and dependencies.
2. Parsed project metadata and educational context from `mkdocs.yml` and `docs/course-description.md`.
3. Pulled quantitative stats from `README.md` since `docs/learning-graph/book-metrics.md` is not present in this repo snapshot.
4. Highlighted MicroSim coverage and learning-graph features via `docs/sims/index.md` and `docs/learning-graph/index.md`.
5. Drafted three LinkedIn announcement variations with emoji bullets, AI transparency, CTAs, and hashtag sets (see final section).

### Full Version
🎓 Thrilled to share that the **Computer Science** intelligent textbook for AP-level Python learners is now live! This open resource packages a complete year-long experience for grades 10–12, blending narrative chapters, concept dependency data, and interactive practice so students can see how each idea builds on the next.

This release pulls together AI-assisted writing, MkDocs Material publishing, and 17 browser-based p5.js MicroSims to turn abstract computing topics into hands-on explorations. Each chapter is grounded in Bloom’s Taxonomy outcomes, backed by a 400-node learning graph, and paired with an ISO 11179 glossary so teachers can trace precisely what each lesson delivers.

📊 **By the numbers**
• 20 chapters covering everything from Python fundamentals to algorithm analysis and advanced language features
• 400 mapped concepts with prerequisite edges plus a 400-term glossary for shared vocabulary
• 17 MicroSims that let students manipulate operators, logic, strings, and more directly in the browser
• 147,000+ words (~590 printed pages) and 600+ runnable code examples with tracing-friendly formatting
• 3,600+ structured learning checklist items and a 100/100 course-description quality score to keep pacing tight

Built with Claude AI skills, MkDocs Material, and open-source tooling, this project shows how GenAI can accelerate curriculum creation while keeping educators in the loop for pedagogy and review.

### Suggested Enhancements
- **Visual:** Screenshot of the learning-graph report or MicroSims grid to spotlight the interactive layer.
- **Timing:** Share Tuesday–Thursday between 8–10am CT when K–12 educators typically scan LinkedIn.
- **Engagement tips:** Tag AP CS instructors or districts piloting Python-first curricula, invite MicroSim requests, and reply to comments within the first hour for algorithmic lift.
