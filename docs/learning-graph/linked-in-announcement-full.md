Thrilled to share that the **Computer Science** intelligent textbook for AP-level Python learners is now live!

This open (Creative Commons) resource packages a complete year-long experience for grades 10–12, blending narrative chapters, learning graphs, taxonomies and concept dependency models, and interactive practice so students can see how each idea builds on the next.  Use it in classrooms for free.  Create a custom version with your school colors in just a few minutes.

This release pulls together AI-assisted writing, MkDocs Material publishing, and browser-based MicroSims to turn abstract computing topics into hands-on explorations. Each chapter is grounded in Bloom’s Taxonomy outcomes,
backed by a 400-node learning graph, and paired with an ISO 11179 glossary so teachers can trace precisely what each lesson delivers.

The new feature of this book is a better focus on using skills to generate our narrative mascot, the friendly python named "Monty".  Monty pops up in about six sections of every chapter to give the student encouragement, advice, friendly warnings and congratulations when they finish each chapter.
Our Claude Code mascot generation skill creates a detailed style guide that you can review before other agents generate the images and customize the CSS for a character consistent user interface.  This book as variations of our mascot for welcome, thinking, encouragement, tips, friendly warning, and congratulations.

**By the numbers:**
• 20 chapters covering everything from Python fundamentals to algorithm analysis and advanced language features
• 400 mapped concepts with prerequisite edges plus a 400-term glossary for shared vocabulary
• 17 MicroSims that let students manipulate operators, logic, strings, and more directly in the browser
• 147,000+ words (~590 printed pages) and 600+ runnable code examples with tracing-friendly formatting
• structured learning checklist items and a detailed Bloom taxonomy learning objectives in our course-description

Built with state-of-the-art skills, this project shows how GenAI can accelerate high-quality pedagogically sound curriculum creation while keeping educators in the loop for pedagogy and review.  Note that this is the first time we have blended both Claude Code and Codex skill execution together.  Checkout the log files in the GitHub repo for details.
