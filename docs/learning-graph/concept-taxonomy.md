# Concept Taxonomy

This document defines the categorical taxonomy used to organize the 400 concepts
in the AP Computer Science (Python Version) learning graph. Each category has a
3-5 letter abbreviation (TaxonomyID) used in the CSV and JSON files.

## Taxonomy Categories

### 1. Foundation Concepts (FOUND)

**TaxonomyID**: FOUND

Prerequisite concepts that provide the foundational knowledge needed before
programming begins. Includes computational thinking, hardware basics, number
systems, and general computer science principles.

**Concept range**: 1-20 (approximately)

### 2. Python Basics (PYBASIC)

**TaxonomyID**: PYBASIC

Core Python language fundamentals including variables, data types, operators,
input/output, and basic expressions. The building blocks for all Python programming.

**Concept range**: 21-50 (approximately)

### 3. Boolean Logic (BOOL)

**TaxonomyID**: BOOL

Boolean expressions, comparison and logical operators, truth tables, and
evaluation rules. Essential for conditional programming and control flow.

**Concept range**: 51-65 (approximately)

### 4. Control Flow (CTRL)

**TaxonomyID**: CTRL

Conditional statements, loops, iteration patterns, and program flow control.
The mechanisms that direct program execution order.

**Concept range**: 66-90 (approximately)

### 5. Strings (STR)

**TaxonomyID**: STR

String data type operations including indexing, slicing, methods, formatting,
and iteration. Working with text data in Python.

**Concept range**: 91-115 (approximately)

### 6. Functions (FUNC)

**TaxonomyID**: FUNC

Function definition, parameters, return values, scope, documentation,
higher-order functions, and lambda expressions. Modular program design.

**Concept range**: 116-142 (approximately)

### 7. Recursion (REC)

**TaxonomyID**: REC

Recursive thinking, base cases, recursive cases, call stacks, and comparison
with iterative approaches. A fundamental algorithmic technique.

**Concept range**: 143-150 (approximately)

### 8. Data Structures (DATA)

**TaxonomyID**: DATA

Lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries - Python's built-in collection types.
Includes creation, manipulation, methods, comprehensions, and nested structures.

**Concept range**: 151-230 (approximately)

### 9. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

**TaxonomyID**: OOP

Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, composition,
and design patterns. The object-oriented paradigm in Python.

**Concept range**: 231-275 (approximately)

### 10. File I/O (FILEIO)

**TaxonomyID**: FILEIO

Reading from and writing to files, file modes, context managers, and
working with CSV and JSON data formats.

**Concept range**: 276-290 (approximately)

### 11. Error Handling (ERR)

**TaxonomyID**: ERR

Exceptions, error types, try-except blocks, raising exceptions, and
defensive programming techniques.

**Concept range**: 291-305 (approximately)

### 12. Testing and Debugging (TEST)

**TaxonomyID**: TEST

Unit testing, test cases, debugging strategies, code tracing, and
quality assurance practices for software development.

**Concept range**: 306-325 (approximately)

### 13. Algorithms (ALGO)

**TaxonomyID**: ALGO

Algorithm design, searching, sorting, complexity analysis (Big-O),
and algorithmic problem-solving strategies.

**Concept range**: 326-360 (approximately)

### 14. Software Engineering (SENG)

**TaxonomyID**: SENG

Software development practices, code organization, modules, packages,
version control, style guides, and documentation.

**Concept range**: 361-380 (approximately)

### 15. Advanced Python (ADVPY)

**TaxonomyID**: ADVPY

Advanced language features including generators, decorators, type hints,
dataclasses, and standard library modules for experienced students.

**Concept range**: 381-400 (approximately)
