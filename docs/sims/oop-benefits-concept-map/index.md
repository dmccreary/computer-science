## About This MicroSim

This interactive concept map places "OOP" at the center with five benefit nodes radiating outward: Organization, Reusability, Encapsulation, Real-world Modeling, and Teamwork. Each benefit includes a brief description and links to concrete code examples from the Dog class.

## How to Use

1. Hover over any benefit node to see an expanded explanation
2. Click a benefit node to highlight the relevant parts of the Dog class code at the bottom
3. Click the same node again to deselect it
4. On narrow screens, the layout switches from a star pattern to a vertical list

## Iframe Embed Code

You can add this MicroSim to any web page by adding this to your HTML:

```html
<iframe src="https://dmccreary.github.io/computer-science/sims/oop-benefits-concept-map/main.html"
        height="550px"
        width="100%"
        scrolling="no"></iframe>
```
