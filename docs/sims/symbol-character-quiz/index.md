## About This MicroSim

This MicroSim quizzes you on the names of the 31 ASCII symbol characters used in programming. A grid displays all the symbols — no letters or digits, just the punctuation and special characters. When you start the quiz, a symbol name appears (like "Ampersand" or "Left Curly Brace") and you click the matching character. Get it wrong and you'll see "Try again!" — get them all right and you earn a confetti celebration!

## How to Use

1. **Set the number of questions** using the slider (1 to 31).
2. **Click "Start Quiz"** to begin.
3. **Read the symbol name** shown below the grid.
4. **Click the matching symbol** in the grid.
5. If correct, you advance to the next question. If wrong, try again until you find the right one.
6. Complete all questions to see a celebration animation!

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Computer Science)

### Duration
10-15 minutes

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with the ASCII Character Map MicroSim
- Basic awareness that programming uses many special characters

### Activities

1. **Warm-Up** (3 min): Have students look at the symbol grid and try to name as many characters as they can before starting the quiz.
2. **Quiz Round 1** (5 min): Start with 10 questions. Students take the quiz individually and note which symbols they miss.
3. **Full Quiz** (5 min): Set the slider to 31 and attempt all symbols. Challenge students to get a perfect score and earn the celebration!

### Assessment

- Can the student correctly identify common programming symbols by name?
- Can the student distinguish between similar symbols (forward slash vs. backslash, parentheses vs. brackets vs. braces)?
- Does the student know the names of less common symbols like tilde, caret, and pipe?
