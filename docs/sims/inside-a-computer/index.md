## About This MicroSim

This MicroSim shows the five main components inside every computer:
**CPU**, **RAM**, **Storage**, **Input Devices**, and **Output Devices**.
Each component is color-coded and connected by arrows that show
how data flows between them. It's a great way to build a mental
map of what's happening inside the box on your desk.

## How to Use

1. **Hover** over any component to see a description and a real-world analogy.
2. **Click** a component to select it — its connecting arrows turn red so you can trace the data path.
3. Press the **Show Data Flow** button to watch animated dots travel along the arrows, showing how data moves between components in real time.
4. Click the button again to hide the animation.

## Lesson Plan

### Grade Level
9-12 (High School Computer Science)

### Duration
10-15 minutes

### Prerequisites

- No prior computer science experience needed.

### Activities

1. **Exploration** (5 min): Hover over each component and read the descriptions. Try to explain each analogy in your own words.
2. **Guided Practice** (5 min): Turn on Data Flow and trace the path data takes from an input device to the CPU, then to an output device. Discuss why RAM and Storage both have two-way arrows with the CPU.
3. **Assessment** (5 min): Without looking at the tooltips, name all five components and describe what each one does in one sentence.

### Assessment

- Can the student name all five components from memory?
- Can the student describe the role of each component using their own words?
- Can the student explain why data flows in both directions between the CPU and RAM/Storage, but only one direction for Input and Output?
