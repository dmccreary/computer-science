# AP Computer Science (Python Version)

## Course Title

AP Computer Science (Python Version)
College-Level Introduction to Computer Science Using Python

---

## Audience

This course is designed for:

* High school students (grades 10–12) seeking a rigorous, college-level computer science experience
* Students interested in STEM, engineering, mathematics, data science, AI, or software development
* Students preparing for university-level CS1 courses taught in Python
* Schools seeking a modern alternative to Java-based AP Computer Science A

This course mirrors the scope and rigor of **College Board AP Computer Science A**, but uses Python as the primary language of instruction.

---

## Prerequisites

Students should have:

* Successful completion of Algebra I (Algebra II recommended)
* Strong logical reasoning and problem-solving skills
* Comfort with abstract thinking
* Basic computer literacy

Prior programming experience is helpful but not required.

---

## Overview

AP Computer Science (Python Version) is a college-level course that introduces students to:

* Computational thinking
* Algorithm design
* Object-oriented programming (OOP)
* Data structures
* Abstraction and modular design
* Program analysis and testing

The course emphasizes disciplined software engineering practices while leveraging Python’s readability and expressive power. Students learn to design, implement, test, and debug multi-module programs.

Although this is not an official AP exam course, it aligns conceptually with the depth and rigor of AP Computer Science A and first-semester university CS courses taught in Python.
