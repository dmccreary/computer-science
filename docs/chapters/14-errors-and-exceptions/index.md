# Errors and Exceptions

## Summary

This chapter teaches students to handle errors gracefully in Python programs. Students will learn to distinguish between syntax, runtime, and logic errors, understand common exception types (TypeError, ValueError, IndexError, KeyError), and use try-except blocks to catch and handle exceptions. The chapter covers raising exceptions, creating custom exception classes, and using assertions for debugging. Proper error handling is essential for writing robust, production-quality software.
