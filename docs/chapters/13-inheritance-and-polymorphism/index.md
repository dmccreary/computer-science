# Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Summary

This chapter extends object-oriented programming with inheritance and polymorphism. Students will learn to create class hierarchies with parent and child classes, use the super() function, override methods, and understand polymorphism and duck typing. The chapter also covers abstract classes, multiple inheritance, operator overloading through dunder methods, iterable and iterator protocols, and UML class diagrams for visualizing object-oriented designs.
