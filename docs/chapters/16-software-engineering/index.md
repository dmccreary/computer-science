# Software Engineering Practices

## Summary

This chapter introduces the practices and tools used in professional software development. Students will learn about the software development lifecycle, modular design principles (DRY, KISS), code organization with Python modules and packages, the pip package manager, and virtual environments. The chapter covers version control with Git, code style with PEP 8, linting tools, refactoring techniques, and writing documentation. Students will also learn the `if __name__ == "__main__"` pattern for writing reusable modules.
