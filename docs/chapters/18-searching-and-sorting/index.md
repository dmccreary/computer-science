# Searching and Sorting

## Summary

This chapter introduces fundamental algorithms for searching and sorting data. Students will learn linear and binary search, then study selection sort, insertion sort, and merge sort (including its recursive implementation). The chapter covers algorithm correctness through loop invariants, Big-O notation for analyzing time and space complexity, and introduces the key complexity classes. Comparing algorithms by their efficiency is a core computer science skill.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 20 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Algorithm Design
2. Pseudocode
3. Flowcharts
4. Linear Search
5. Binary Search
6. Search Comparison
7. Selection Sort
8. Insertion Sort
9. Merge Sort
10. Merge Sort Recursion
11. Sorting Comparison
12. Stable vs Unstable Sort
13. Algorithm Correctness
14. Loop Invariants
15. Big-O Notation
16. Time Complexity
17. Space Complexity
18. Constant Time O(1)
19. Linear Time O(n)
20. Quadratic Time O(n^2)
