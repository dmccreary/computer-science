# Tuples and Sets

## Summary

This chapter covers two important Python collection types: tuples and sets. Students will learn about tuple creation, immutability, packing and unpacking, and when to use tuples vs lists. The chapter then introduces sets and their mathematical operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference), membership testing, and frozensets. These data structures complement lists and dictionaries for different use cases.
