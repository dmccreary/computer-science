# Advanced List Operations

## Summary

This chapter deepens the understanding of Python lists with advanced operations. Students will learn about shallow and deep copying, list concatenation and repetition, the sorted function, using lists as stacks and queues, and the important distinction between aliasing (identity) and equality. These concepts are critical for writing correct programs that manipulate collections of data.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 15 concepts from the learning graph:

1. List Copying
2. Shallow Copy
3. Deep Copy
4. List Concatenation
5. List Repetition
6. In Operator for Lists
7. Index Method
8. Count Method
9. Min Max Sum Functions
10. Len Function for Lists
11. Sorted Function
12. List as Stack
13. List as Queue
14. List Aliasing
15. Identity vs Equality
