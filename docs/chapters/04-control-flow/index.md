# Control Flow

## Summary

This chapter covers the mechanisms that control the order of program execution. Students will learn conditional statements (if, elif, else), for and while loops, break and continue statements, and nested control structures. The chapter introduces common iteration patterns including the accumulator, counter, sentinel value, and flag variable patterns that are essential for solving real programming problems.

This chapter covers the following 25 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Control Flow
2. Sequential Execution
3. Conditional Statements
4. If Statement

12. While Loop
13. Range Function
14. Loop Variable
15. Loop Body
16. Infinite Loops
17. Break Statement
18. Continue Statement
19. Nested Loops
20. Loop Patterns
21. Accumulator Pattern
22. Counter Pattern
23. Sentinel Value Pattern
