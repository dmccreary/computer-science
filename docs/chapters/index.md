## How to Use This Textbook

Chapters are designed to be read in order, as each chapter builds on concepts from previous ones. The learning graph ensures that all prerequisite concepts are covered before they are needed. If you are already familiar with certain topics, you can skip ahead, but be sure to review the concept list in each chapter to confirm you have the prerequisite knowledge.
