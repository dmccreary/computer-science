# Higher-Order Functions and Recursion

## Summary

This chapter covers two powerful programming paradigms: higher-order functions and recursion. Students will learn to write lambda functions, use map/filter/reduce, and compose functions. The chapter then introduces recursive thinking, including identifying base and recursive cases, tracing the call stack, and comparing recursive vs iterative solutions. These techniques are essential for elegant problem solving.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 16 concepts from the learning graph:

1. Function Documentation
2. Helper Functions
3. Main Function Pattern
4. Lambda Functions
5. Higher-Order Functions
6. Map Function
7. Filter Function
8. Reduce Function
9. Function Composition
10. Recursion
11. Base Case
12. Recursive Case
13. Recursive Call Stack
14. Stack Overflow
15. Recursion vs Iteration
16. Recursive Patterns
