# Classes and Objects

## Summary

This chapter introduces object-oriented programming in Python. Students will learn to define classes, create objects, work with instance and class attributes, write constructors and methods, and understand the self parameter. The chapter covers encapsulation through private attributes, getter/setter methods, and the property decorator. These concepts enable students to model real-world entities in their programs.
