# Testing and Debugging

## Summary

This chapter covers the essential practices of testing and debugging software. Students will learn manual and unit testing, how to write effective test cases and assertions, identify edge cases and boundary conditions, and practice test-driven development. The chapter also teaches debugging strategies including print debugging, using debugger tools with breakpoints, code tracing, and rubber duck debugging. Defensive programming and input validation techniques round out the quality assurance toolkit.
